Jan 23rd to 29th
I was having issue with my TMC-2130 schematic on altium. It was messing up my 35 and 36 pins renaming them and remapping them which was causing issues.
I was able to correct the issues recieved Dr. Lusher approval to have the designs sent off and be printed off. The orders shall ship on the 30th and the 31st according
to Advanced PCB. I will order the required parts begining of next week so they should arrive before the PCBs.

Jan 30th to Feb 5th
I have collected the parts needed for the new PCB and have requested approval for the orders. The parts have been ordered. Due to the ice storm that occured last week in
Texas, my PCBs and part orders have been delayed and are arriving next week. One Order did arrive Friday late in the afternoon.

Feb 6th to 12th
Parts were all recieved Tuesday and started soldering on Wednesday. I completed the soldering of the Control board on Thursday and have approxamately 90% of the Stepper
Motor Control Board complete. Plan is to still have the boards validated by February 15tg and ready for for intergration.

Feb 13th to 19th
PCBs have been completely soldered and started to validating both boards. Ran into issue with the MOSFET switching with an input voltage and over the weekend but unable
to get it working. I also had an issue with the axis driver getting 5Vs on a pin in the Axis driver/Main Controller board connector that shouldnt be getting the voltage.
I worked on both problems over the weekend without any success and will talk to Dr. Lusher on Monday for advice.

Feb 20th to 26th
Talking to Dr. Lusher Monday morning, discovered I was using to low of a voltage for my MOSFETs so will try testing them at 3.3V. He also recommended grounding the pin
thats getting the 5V with a 1k ohm resistor to see if there is an internal switch that isnt closing since the pin is free floating. On Wednesday I was able to validate
all the drivers except the X-axis driver. Come to find out that the original TMC-2130 chip was burnt out and the I tried using one off my old board from 403 but the 
VCC_IO pin was getting 3.3V but wasnt turning on the chip as required. I ordered 3 more chips and they arrived on Friday but didn't have time to solder them.

Feb 27th to Mar 5th
I was able to solder the new chip onto the board and validate the X-driver which completed the validation of the electronic components of the project.
