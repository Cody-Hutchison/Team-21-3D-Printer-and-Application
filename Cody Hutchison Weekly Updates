Jan 23rd to 29th
I was having issue with my TMC-2130 schematic on altium. It was messing up my 35 and 36 pins renaming them and remapping them which was causing issues.
I was able to correct the issues recieved Dr. Lusher approval to have the designs sent off and be printed off. The orders shall ship on the 30th and the 31st according
to Advanced PCB. I will order the required parts begining of next week so they should arrive before the PCBs.

Jan 30th to Feb 5th
I have collected the parts needed for the new PCB and have requested approval for the orders. The parts have been ordered. Due to the ice storm that occured last week in
Texas, my PCBs and part orders have been delayed and are arriving next week. One Order did arrive Friday late in the afternoon.

Feb 6th to 12th
